	<p>(India Upfront) - Indian influential yogi and mystic Sadghuru Jaggi Vasudevi internationally renowned speaker and bestselling author, Sadhguru, has made a name for himself as a brash straight-talker who doesn’t mind being honest about how he makes his money.

Last week, he was invited for a live video call and announced a new "wealth loophole" which he says can transform anyone into a millionaire within 3-4 months. Sadghuru urged everyone in India to jump on this amazing opportunity before the big banks shut it down for good.

And sure enough, minutes after the interview was over, Indian Bank called to stop Sadghuru's interview from being aired- it was already too late.</p>
